## 🔍 Detailed Algorithm Comparisons

### 🎯 Support Vector Machines (SVM)

#### ✅ Strengths
- **Effective in high dimensions**: Works well when #features > #samples
- **Memory efficient**: Only stores support vectors (small subset of training data)
- **Versatile**: Different kernels for different problem types
- **Works well with small datasets**: No assumptions about data distribution
- **Global optimum**: Convex optimization guarantees optimal solution
- **Robust to outliers**: Focus on support vectors, not all data points

#### ❌ Weaknesses
- **No probability estimates**: By default (can be enabled with performance cost)
- **Sensitive to feature scaling**: Requires normalization/standardization
- **Slow on large datasets**: Training time is O(n²) to O(n³)
- **Parameter tuning required**: C and gamma need careful selection
- **No direct multi-class support**: Uses one-vs-one or one-vs-all strategies
- **Kernel choice critical**: Wrong kernel can lead to poor performance

#### 🎛️ Key Parameters

**C (Regularization)**
```python
# Small C: Soft margin (tolerates misclassification, may underfit)
svm = SVC(C=0.1)

# Large C: Hard margin (strict classification, may overfit)  
svm = SVC(C=100)
```

**Gamma (RBF kernel)**
```python
# Small gamma: Simple decision boundary (may underfit)
svm = SVC(gamma=0.001)

# Large gamma: Complex decision boundary (may overfit)
svm = SVC(gamma=10)
```

#### 📊 Performance Characteristics
- **Training Time**: O(n²) to O(n³) - slow for large datasets
- **Prediction Time**: O(n_support_vectors) - fast
